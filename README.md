I am Srinivas Kolluru, a Postdoctoral research associate at University of Georgiaâ€™s Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO). My former training is in remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems, and I earned a Ph.D. in ocean color remote sensing from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. My doctoral thesis is titled Retrieval of water quality parameters from multi-spectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data of coastal and inland waters. My graduate training involved extensive use hyperspectral and multispectral satellite/aerial remote sensing image analysis relevant to water quality and aquatic ecosystem health. Prior joining in SkIO, I finished a two-year postdoctoral term working on algorithm development for deriving inherent optical properties of aquatic medium at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute (HBOI), Florida Atlantic University. My main area of research lies within aquatic remote sensing, algorithm development and applied science pertaining to aquatic biogeochemical parameters. I published eleven peer-reviewed manuscripts in international journals, a book chapter and 15 conference publications.
